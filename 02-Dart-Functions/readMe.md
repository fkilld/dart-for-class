In Dart, the “arrow function” (also known as an **arrow syntax** function) is simply **shorthand** for functions with **single-expression** bodies. Both arrow functions and regular functions work the same way at runtime—they take parameters, can return values, and so on. The main **differences** are in **syntax** and **limitations** on the function body.

## 1. Syntax and Usage

### Arrow Function

* Uses the **`=>`** (fat arrow) syntax.
* Must have **exactly one expression** in the body.
* The expression’s value is  **implicitly returned** .

```dart
// Arrow syntax
int add(int a, int b) => a + b;  
```

### Regular (Block) Function

* Uses curly braces  **`{ ... }`** .
* Can contain  **multiple statements** .
* Must use **`return`** to send a value back (unless `void` or no return value is needed).

```dart
// Regular function with a block body
int add(int a, int b) {
  int sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}
```

## 2. Key Differences

1. **Body Constraints**

   * **Arrow Function** :

   - Can only contain a **single** expression.
   - The result of that expression is  **implicitly returned** .

   * **Regular Function** :

   - Can contain  **multiple statements** , loops, conditionals, local variables, etc.
   - Must explicitly `return` a value if you want to return something.
2. **Readability & Conciseness**

   * **Arrow Functions** are concise and **great for simple one-line operations** (like a short computation, a quick transformation, or a single return statement).
   * **Regular Functions** can be more verbose but are necessary when you have multiple lines of logic.
3. **Behavior**

   * Both arrow and regular functions **behave identically** in terms of capturing variables (closures), scoping, and how they are called. The difference is purely  **syntactic** .

## 3. Examples

### 3.1. One-Line Logic

**Arrow function** is perfect:

```dart
String greet(String name) => 'Hello, $name!';
```

Equivalent  **regular function** :

```dart
String greet(String name) {
  return 'Hello, $name!';
}
```

### 3.2. Multiple Statements

Must use  **regular function** :

```dart
String greetInDetail(String name) {
  String greeting = 'Hello, $name!';
  print('Logging greeting: $greeting');
  return greeting;
}
```

*(This can’t be done with a single-expression arrow function.)*

---

## 4. Summary

* Use **arrow functions** (`=>`) for **simple one-liners** or quick return statements.
* Use **regular functions** (`{ ... }`) when you have  **multiple statements** , need more complex logic, or want explicit returns.
* Beyond syntax and body constraints, **both function types** are **functionally the same** in Dart.
